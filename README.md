# Weather Data API
• This Flask-based web application serves as a simple weather data API that reads historical temperature data from text files and exposes it through various API endpoints. The project includes endpoints to retrieve temperature information for a specific station and date, all available data for a station, or all records for a specific year. Additionally, it features a basic homepage that displays a list of available weather stations in HTML table format. This project is ideal for learning how to build <b>RESTful APIs</b> with <b>Flask</b>, work with <b>pandas</b> for <b>data processing</b>, and organize simple data visualization through a web interface
